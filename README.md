## Project Description
This project is the foundation to the Full-Stack Web Developer Course from Career Foundry.
It will contain a collection of the items I build in an online design portfolio.

Building this site and pages allowed me to learn:
- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Animations with SVG
- SCSS (https://www.sassmeister.com/)
- Transpiler (https://madlittlemods.github.io/postcss-css-variables/playground/)
- Using Auto Prefixers (https://autoprefixer.github.io/)
